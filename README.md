# Typing Rush â€” React + Vite + Tailwind

A fast, juicy typing game built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.  
Type falling words to destroy them. Use **power words** and switch **modes** to crank the chaos. Fully mobile-ready.

## âœ¨ Features

- **4 Modes**: Easy (stage-based word lists), Medium, Hard, **Extreme** (double words like `car bike`)
- **Powers (guaranteed every 15 spawns)**:
  - `SLOW` â†’ bullet-time (0.2Ã— speed; spawn rate slows too)
  - `POWER` â†’ +1 heart when you type it fully
- **True Pause**: game loop fully stops; SLOW timer doesnâ€™t drain while paused
- **Per-Mode High Scores**: stored in `localStorage` (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `extreme`)
- **Mobile Responsive**: sticky typing bar, safe-area padding, responsive word sizes
- **Confetti**: small pop when beating the current modeâ€™s high; big blast on new best at Game Over
